# scottylol

Scottylol is an exciting search tool for CMU. It is ScottyLabs' implementation of Facebook's internal bunnylol search tool.

## Setup `scottylol` as your search engine

  - Navigate to search engine settings on your browser
  - Add a new search engine called `scottylol` and set the url to `https://scotty.lol/search?q=%s`
  - Make `scottylol` your default search engine
  - Type `token query` in your browser's search bar to see the power of `scottylol`. For example, `course 15251` will search our course tool for 15251!
  - See below for how to add more useful commands to `scottylol` :)

### Noob Version

  - Designed for users accustomed to using Google search from search bar. Redirects to Google search if search terms do not match a scotty.lol command.
  - To set up, follow the above instructions, but use the following URL for the search engine: `https://scotty.lol/noob?q=%s`
